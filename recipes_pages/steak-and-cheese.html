        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a recipe that will make three sandwiches, so I would suggest sharing with friends. In terms of preparations, it doesn't take too long to prepare. It is also highly customizable as you can put all kinds of sauces and have it with a multitude of sides. I would recommend mayonnaise and the fajita mix in the sandwich. I would also recommend fries, vegetables, and/or chips as sides.</p>
