        <h2 class="heading sub-topic">Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is a favorite of mine. It has a good mix of spiciness and sweetness with a buttery undertone. Pair it with a little bit of salt and it is one of the tastiest things on this planet. The sauce can be found in Wal-Mart although I would imagine that it could be found somewhere else. Most of the metric in the ingredients will depend on how many people you feed, so if you're only feeding yourself, I would recommend choosing the lower end and you may have leftovers after you are done.</p>

        <h2 class="heading sub-topic">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Get a rice cooker or pan and coat the bottom with non-stick cooking spray then pour in the rice, coat it in olive oil, and pour in one cup of water. For people with pan in hand, I will recommend bringing the water to boil and then letting it simmer until rice is tender.</li>

            <li>Spray a pan with non-stick cooking spray and put the chicken in seasoned with salt & pepper and garlic paste. Have it at high heat for 4-5 minutes. You may have to flip the chicken halfway through to ensure it doesn't stick to the pan. Bring it to low heat for 10 minutes. Flip the chicken a few times during the 10 minutes.</li>
