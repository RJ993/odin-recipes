     <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>I will admit, this recipe was one that I threw together haphazardly one day. Yet, the taste is something to die for. It takes minimal preparation and attention to make it. I did not use peanuts when I made and took pictures of the final product simply because I didn't have it on hand. Peanuts is <strong>not</strong> required but it will make the dish tasty.</p>

     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>TGI Friday's Boneless Chicken Buffalo Bites aka Chicken Balls</li>

        <li>Peanuts</li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Get a rice cooker or pan and coat the bottom with non-stick cooking spray then pour in the rice, coat it in olive oil, and pour in one cup of water. For people with pan in hand, I will recommend bringing the water to boil and then letting it simmer until rice is tender.</li>
