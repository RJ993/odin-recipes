     <h2 class="heading sub-topic">Description</h2>
     <p>I will admit, this recipe was one that I threw together haphazardly one day. Yet, the taste is something to die for. It takes minimal preparation and attention to make it. I did not use peanuts when I made and took pictures of the final product simply because I didn't have it on hand. Peanuts is <strong>not</strong> required but it will make the dish tasty.</p>

     <h2 class="heading sub-topic">Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Get a rice cooker or pan and coat the bottom with non-stick cooking spray then pour in the rice, coat it in olive oil, and pour in one cup of water. For people with pan in hand, I will recommend bringing the water to boil and then letting it simmer until rice is tender. <img class="ingredients-steps" src="recipes_images/sweet-asian-chicken/rice.jpg" alt="Step one"></li>
        <li>Put the balls in the air fryer at 380 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 minutes. <img class="ingredients-steps" src="recipes_images/gen-tso-chicken-balls/ball-air-fryer.jpg" alt="Step two"></li>
        <li>Cut up the balls and put it in a pot along with the sauce and peanuts. <img class="ingredients-steps" src="recipes_images/gen-tso-chicken-balls/tso-ball.jpg" alt="Step three"></li>
        <li>Put it all in a bowl. Enjoy!</li>
     </ol>
